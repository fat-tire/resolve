# Define which host folders will be accessible inside the Resolve container.

# 2. List absolute or home (~) paths below it.
# 3. Uncomment and edit as needed.

# Default mount point (do not change)
TARGET=/opt/resolve/Media

# === ADD YOUR MEDIA FOLDERS BELOW ===
#/home/user/Videos


# === CUSTOM MOUNT POINTS ===
# To mount elsewhere, define a new TARGET:
#TARGET=/mnt/CustomFolder
#/mnt/ExternalDrive/Project

# After adding new paths:
